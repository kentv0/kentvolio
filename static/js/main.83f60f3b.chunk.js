Test in real action. Also to be quite frank, I honestly needed to do more research before I can begin to explain a structure or process. Below I have crafted a unit test for the chat locker login module. I realized how more fluid unit testing become once I began to plan ahead. Before any Unit Testing its always a good idea to write down a table of all the case scenarios so that we do not overthink our unit tests. Initially I planned using a notepad, then I formatted it thoroughly in Excel. From there I structured my code with empty but descriptive method names.".concat("\n\n","Now a big step that most people skip is to simply study a component. In this case I studied the login module. Why is this so? Greattttt questionnnn. A unit test is being able to take pre-defined inputs and expect an output. This expected output would hint the overall behavior of your component. You would need to understand the overall behavior so your unit testing is thorough in every case. Lets put all this generalized explanation into something more tangible.","\n\n","For the login module we had had the option of using either a valid Username or Email paired with a valid Password."),content4:"So it is important to note that we can only use one or the other; either username and email and never the two at once.

Go to the next page for a Unit Test Example.","\n\n","Lets take a look at the code below and then discuss the best practices that I have applied.","\n\n","1. Try to avoid the use of ImplicitWait and instead use ExplicitWait or even better FluentWait. Reason: Loading elements may vary from page to page so predictable loading times are difficult to guess. Implicit wait is used to wait x amount of time despite an element already being loaded (which could slow down the test overall when you have several thousand lines combined). The mixture of implicit and explicit may also result in unwanted unpredictability. (ie. If you implicitly wait 3 seconds for a page to load but it loads at 5 seconds, then any attempts to access it's DOM may result in errors)","\n\n"," 2. Do not use Selenium alone, instead also incorporate JUnit or TestNG or some other Frameworks for better coverage. Selenium has its advantages and disadvantages. In the code below you will see the use of JUnit. I found the greatest useful portion of JUnit is the method order execution tags (@before , @test and @after).
